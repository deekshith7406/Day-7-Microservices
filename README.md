**Terminal 1 — Config Server (port 8888)**
```bash
cd config-server
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Wait for it to finish starting, then verify it can see the config repo:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8888/USER-SERVICE/dev
```
You should get back a JSON document listing `propertySources`, including
values from both `USER-SERVICE-dev.properties` and the base
`USER-SERVICE.properties`.

**Terminal 2 — Discovery Server (port 8761)**
```bash
cd discovery-server
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Open http://localhost:8761 — you should see the Eureka dashboard with no
instances registered yet.

**Terminal 3 — User Service (port 8081)**
```bash
cd user-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Terminal 4 — Order Service (port 8082)**
```bash
cd order-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Refresh the Eureka dashboard — `USER-SERVICE` and `ORDER-SERVICE` should
now both appear under "Instances currently registered with Eureka." If
they don't show up within ~30s, check that each service's console log
shows a successful registration (not a connection-refused retry loop) and
that `discovery-server` is really up first.

**Terminal 5 — API Gateway (port 8080)**
```bash
cd api-gateway
mvn spring-boot:run
```


## Step 3/4 — the successful path (Day 5, direct calls — still works)

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/users/1001
# {"id":1001,"name":"John","email":"john@example.com"}

curl http://localhost:8082/orders/5001
# {"orderId":5001,"userId":1001,"userName":"John"}
```

The second call only succeeds because Order Service made a real HTTP
request to User Service and used the response — check User Service's
console log for the incoming request if you want to see it happen.
This still calls the fixed `user.service.base-url` from Day 5 — Day 6
doesn't change this internal call (see the Day 6 section below for why).

## Step 5 / Hands-on Challenge 2 — break it on purpose (Day 5 version)

```bash
# Stop User Service (Ctrl+C in Terminal 1), then:
curl -i http://localhost:8082/orders/5001
```

You'll get:
```json
{
  "error": "USER_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE",
  "message": "User service is unavailable. Please try again later.",
  "status": 503,
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

That response comes from `GlobalExceptionHandler`, not a try/catch in
`OrderController` — the handbook explicitly prefers centralized handling
over scattering try/catch blocks through controllers, so that's what this
does.

Restart User Service and confirm the normal response comes back:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8082/orders/5001
# back to {"orderId":5001,"userId":1001,"userName":"John"}
```

## Day 6 — Discovery Server + API Gateway

Everything above still works exactly as before — Day 6 doesn't change
User Service, Order Service's controller, or `UserClient`. What's new is
two more processes: `discovery-server` (the registry) and `api-gateway`
(the single client entry point), plus a small config change so
User Service and Order Service *register themselves*.

### Hands-on Challenge 3 — call both services through the gateway

With all four processes running (see "Running it" above), the client can
now use one address instead of two:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/users/1001
# {"id":1001,"name":"John","email":"john@example.com"}
# same response as calling User Service directly on 8081

curl http://localhost:8080/orders/5001
# {"orderId":5001,"userId":1001,"userName":"John"}
# same response as calling Order Service directly on 8082
```

The routing table lives entirely in
`api-gateway/src/main/resources/application.yml` — `lb://USER-SERVICE` and
`lb://ORDER-SERVICE` target the **registered service names**, not a fixed
host/port. The gateway asks the discovery server "where is USER-SERVICE
right now?" on each request instead of having `localhost:8081` written
down anywhere.

### Deliberately break something (Section 17)

Stop User Service (Ctrl+C in its terminal) while the discovery server and
gateway keep running:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/users/1001
```

You'll get an error (a gateway-level failure, since there's no
`USER_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` translation here the way Order Service has —
the gateway is plain routing, not a place for business-level error
contracts, per Section 20's "don't put business logic in the gateway").
Refresh the Eureka dashboard — after a short delay, `USER-SERVICE` will
drop out of the registered instances list (Eureka needs a few missed
heartbeats to notice, so this isn't instant).

Restart User Service, wait for it to re-register (check the dashboard),
and confirm the gateway call works again — no gateway restart needed.

**Worth reasoning through** (Section 17's own questions): the discovery
server knew User Service *used to be* available and eventually noticed it
wasn't; the gateway performed the routing; the client was only ever
talking to the gateway, and never knew User Service's address changed,
went away, or came back.

### Scope note: Order Service's own call to User Service is unchanged

Order Service now *registers* as `ORDER-SERVICE`, but `UserClient` still
calls the fixed `user.service.base-url` from Day 5 (`http://localhost:8081`),
not a discovered `USER-SERVICE` address. This is a deliberate scope
decision, not an oversight:

- The handbook's own concrete, given code for discovery-based routing
  (`lb://USER-SERVICE`) is Gateway-specific (Spring Cloud Gateway's route
  URIs). It doesn't give equivalent concrete code for a plain
  `RestClient` to resolve a logical service name, and explicitly hedges:
  *"The exact client configuration depends on the Spring Boot / Spring
  Cloud version used by your project."*
- The Day 6 checklist and Mini Project's required list (Section 21) only
  ask for: discovery server running, both services registered, gateway
  routing to both, and the **client** (external caller) using port 8080
  instead of calling services directly. Order Service's internal call to
  User Service isn't in that required list.

If you want to take it further yourself: Spring Cloud Commons supports a
`@LoadBalanced RestClient.Builder` (or `RestTemplate`) that resolves a
logical name like `http://USER-SERVICE` through the same discovery
mechanism the gateway uses — but exactly which annotation/API applies
depends on your Spring Cloud version, per the handbook's own caveat above.
Worth trying as a stretch exercise; not included here to avoid shipping
version-fragile code as if it were verified.

## Day 7 — Centralized Configuration

Same shape as before: nothing about `UserController`, `OrderController`,
`UserClient`, the gateway routes, or Eureka registration changes. What's
new is `config-server` (serving `config-repo/`, a real local git repo) and
a handful of properties in User Service and Order Service that now come
from there instead of a local file.

### What actually moved (Hands-on Challenge 1)

| Property | Lived here through Day 6 | Lives here as of Day 7 |
|---|---|---|
| `user.service.base-url` | `order-service/application.properties` | `config-repo/ORDER-SERVICE.properties` |
| `app.message`, `app.environment` | didn't exist yet | `config-repo/USER-SERVICE*.properties`, `config-repo/ORDER-SERVICE*.properties` |

`RestClientConfig.java` (which reads `user.service.base-url`) did not
change a single line for that move — only `application.properties` (fewer
lines) and the new `config-repo/ORDER-SERVICE.properties` (one more line)
changed. That's the acceptance criteria from Section 12, demonstrated
concretely: **application behavior changed through configuration, not
Java source.**

### Prove it (Section 9 / Section 11)

Query Config Server directly first, to see what it's serving before any
service even starts:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8888/USER-SERVICE/dev
curl http://localhost:8888/ORDER-SERVICE/dev
```

Then, with User Service and Order Service running, confirm they actually
picked those values up:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/config/message
# Hello from DEV centralized config

curl http://localhost:8081/config/environment
# DEV

curl http://localhost:8082/config/message
# Hello from DEV centralized config (Order Service)

curl -i http://localhost:8082/orders/5001
# still works — user.service.base-url came from Config Server this time,
# not from order-service's own application.properties
```

### Hands-on Challenge 2 — DEV vs TEST

`config-repo/USER-SERVICE-test.properties` and
`config-repo/ORDER-SERVICE-test.properties` already exist with different
values. Switch profiles without touching any Java or config-repo file:

```bash
cd user-service
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--spring.profiles.active=test
```
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/config/environment
# TEST
curl http://localhost:8081/config/message
# Hello from TEST centralized config
```
Restart with `--spring.profiles.active=dev` (or no argument — `dev` is the
default in `application.properties`) to switch back.

### Hands-on Challenge 3 — break configuration

Stop Config Server, then start (or restart) User Service or Order Service.

**What actually happens here, and why it's worth reading carefully:**
`spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888` means
Spring Boot won't refuse to *attempt* startup just because Config Server
is unreachable — the `optional:` prefix suppresses the hard failure that
would otherwise occur at the config-import step itself. But it does
**not** supply fallback values for `${app.message}`, `${app.environment}`,
or `${user.service.base-url}`. Those properties simply don't exist
anywhere else in this project's setup. So:

```bash
cd order-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```
You should see the application still fail to start — but now failing
later, at bean-creation time, with something like
`Could not resolve placeholder 'user.service.base-url'`, not at the
config-import step. That's the distinction Section 20's "Making every
configuration value mandatory without considering startup behavior"
mistake is pointing at: *fetching* config was optional; the *properties
being present* was not, because nothing local ever defined them as a
fallback.

**To see the other side of that distinction** — a genuinely optional
setting — try adding a default inline, e.g. in `ConfigController`:
```java
@Value("${app.message:Default message (Config Server unavailable)}")
private String message;
```
Restart Order Service with Config Server still stopped: this time it
starts fine, and `GET /config/message` returns the inline default instead
of failing. That's the real lesson: "optional" has to be decided
per-property, not once for the whole config-import step.

Restart Config Server and confirm both services return to their normal
centrally-configured values.

### Eureka vs. Gateway vs. Config Server — what each one actually answers

Easy to blur together once all three exist. Each answers one question:

| Component | Question it answers | Port |
|---|---|---|
| **Discovery Server** (Eureka) | "Where is USER-SERVICE running right now?" | 8761 |
| **API Gateway** | "This incoming request path — which service should handle it?" | 8080 |
| **Config Server** | "What configuration values should USER-SERVICE use?" | 8888 |

None of them replace the others, and losing one doesn't take the others
down with it — you can (and did, above) stop Config Server while
discovery and routing keep working fine; the services just fall back to
whatever configuration they already loaded, or fail to start if that
configuration was never optional in the first place.

## Automated tests

`OrderControllerTest` covers both paths from the "Mini Project" checklist
without needing two live processes during a build — `UserClient` is
mocked so each test controls exactly what "User Service" does:

```bash
cd order-service
mvn test
```

- `returnsOrderWithUserDetails_whenUserServiceRespondsSuccessfully` — the
  successful end-to-end path
- `returns503_whenUserServiceIsUnavailable` — User Service unreachable

(These are the practical equivalent of the handbook's "a successful
end-to-end test" and "a test for User Service being unavailable" —
a true multi-process end-to-end test is the manual curl walkthrough above.)

## Day 5 Section 12 — configuration mini-exercise (User Service port swap)

Try this yourself to confirm the URL really is external to the Java code:

1. Stop User Service.
2. Change its port: edit `user-service/src/main/resources/application.properties`,
   set `server.port=9091`.
3. Update **only** Order Service's config — edit
   `order-service/src/main/resources/application.properties`,
   set `user.service.base-url=http://localhost:9091`.
4. Restart both services.
5. Call `curl http://localhost:8082/orders/5001` again — it should work,
   and you never touched `UserClient.java` or `RestClientConfig.java`.
6. Put both files back to `8081` / `http://localhost:8081` afterward.

## Connecting today to Day 4

The handbook asks you to map this call onto yesterday's resilience
concepts. This project intentionally does **not** implement timeout,
retry, or a circuit breaker — Day 5's focus is the communication mechanics
themselves — but here's where each would slot in if it did:

| Day 4 pattern | Where it would go here |
|---|---|
| **Timeout** | On the `RestClient` — Spring's `RestClient` delegates to an underlying `ClientHttpRequestFactory`; you'd configure its connect/read timeout, same idea as `order-service`'s `paymentRestTemplate` in the Day 1–4 platform project. |
| **Retry** | Around `UserClient.getUser(...)`, limited to a few attempts, only for exceptions that look transient (connection refused, timeout) — not for a legitimate 4xx. |
| **Circuit breaker** | Also around `UserClient.getUser(...)`, so repeated failures stop hitting User Service for a cooldown period instead of retrying forever. |
| **Fallback** | Already partially here in spirit — `GlobalExceptionHandler` turns any `RestClientException` into a clear 503, never a raw stack trace. A "real" fallback would live at the same layer, potentially returning cached/default data instead of just an error. |

If you want to see all four of these actually implemented and wired up
with Resilience4j against a deliberately-breakable dependency, that's
exactly what Day 4 built in the `one-enterprise-platform` project
(`order-service`'s `PaymentServiceClient` + `RESILIENCE.md`).

## What changed between Section 5 and Section 11 in this repo

- `RestClientConfig` in this project already reflects **Section 11's**
  fix (externalized `user.service.base-url`), not Section 5's hard-coded
  version — so you're looking at the "after" state. If you want to
  experience the "before" state the handbook describes, try hard-coding
  `.baseUrl("http://localhost:8081")` directly in `RestClientConfig`
  first, get it working, and then refactor to the externalized version
  yourself — that refactor *is* the Section 11 exercise.
